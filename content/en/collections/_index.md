## Contributing to Middleware Automation

Get involved! One of the ways you can contribute to the Middleware Automation collections is by adding documentation. 

Here is what you can do:

- Look for existing documentation issues for the middleware project you want to contribute to. For example, look for doc issues in the WildFly repo at: https://github.com/ansible-middleware/wildfly/issues.
- If you know about a doc fix but don't see a corresponding issue, go ahead and create a new issue in the repository. A good place to start is the README.md file for each project. These often need to be expanded or improved.
- Fork the repository for the middleware project if you already haven't.
- Apply the changes to your docs and send a pull request to the project.
