{{% pageinfo %}}
The capabilities provided by Ansible Middleware, much like the rest of Ansibleâ€™s featureset, are just the foundation for the possibilities that can be realized. Including the collections within your automation activities is easy and enables you to supercharge managing Red Hat Runtimes anywhere -- from the datacenter, to the edge, to the public cloud.

## Contribution Guidelines
- All YAML files named with '.yml' extension
- Use spaces around jinja variables. {{ var }} over {{var}}
Variables that are internal to the role should be lowercase and start with the role name
- Keep roles self contained - Roles should avoid including tasks from other roles when possible
- Plays should do nothing more than include a list of roles except where pre_tasks and post_tasks are required when possible
- Separators - Use valid name, ie. underscores (e.g. my_role my_playbook) not dashes (my-role)
Paths - When defining paths, do not include trailing slashes (e.g. my_path: /foo not my_path: /foo/). When concatenating paths, follow the same convention (e.g. {{ my_path }}/bar not {{ my_path }}bar)
- Indentation - Use 2 spaces for each indent
vars/ vs defaults/ - internal or interpolated variables that don't need to change or be overridden by users go in vars/, those that a user would likely override, go under defaults/ directory
- All arguments have a specification in meta/argument_specs.yml
- All playbooks/roles should be focused on compatibility with Ansible Automation Platform controller
